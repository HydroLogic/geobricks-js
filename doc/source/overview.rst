The geobricks way
==================

Geobricks is a collaborative way of working that aims at sharing efforts in order to let everybody meet their requirements in a faster, cheaper and more robust way.

This collaborative way of working is materialized into different projects that depend on specific technologies. We have:

- geobricks-js
- geobricks-XXX

**What is this collaborative way about?**

It is about writing **reusable components** and maintaining a **design pattern database**. See below.

Reusable components
-------------------

Reusable components must be:

* **modular**: so that it is technically possible to include it on other applications
* **well documented**: so that it is easy to understand how to include it 

These are the most important features of a *geobrick*, but there are other properties that are also desirable: smaller technology stack, simplicity, etc.

Geobricks is your way. When building a module don't make a Swiss knife thinking on all the people that will use it. Because it will be too expensive and diverge from your way. **Just satisfy your needs**, but in a way someone with exactly the same needs can benefit: modular and documented. You will lose very few time making your code modular and documented and you can get the ROI even in the very same project.

Pattern lifecyle
----------------

One key part of the *geobricks way* is the pattern database. Building similar projects we find similar problems and it is a good practice to share and improve solutions to these. So, as natural selection does:

* **Propose new patterns**: When a non trivial problem has annoyed you for a time and you found a good solution, share it in the pattern database. Maybe your solution is not perfect and someone will improve it.
* **Validate (or invalidate) existing patterns**: When using an existing pattern, share your experience. "A pattern" is not the same than "a pattern that has been used 100 times successfully". 
* **Use established patterns**: Build on others experience. If something is wrong, propose modifications to the pattern.
